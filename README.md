### EXPERIMENT 2 BOOLEAN_FUNCTION_MINIMIZATION
### NAME : SOMESHWAR S
### REG NO : 24006709

### AIM
 To implement the given logic function verify its operation in Quartus using Verilog programming.
 F1= A’B’C’D’+AC’D’+B’CD’+A’BCD+BC’D
 F2=xy’z+x’y’z+w’xy+wx’y+wxy
### EQUIPMENT REQUIRED
 Hardware – PCs, Cyclone II , USB flasher
 THEORY
 Implementing Boolean functions in Verilog HDL (Hardware Description Language) involves
 translating the simplified Boolean expressions into Verilog code to describe the behavior of digital
 circuits. The basic building blocks in Verilog is module. The module represent a combinational
 circuit. Use logical operators (&, |, ~, ^) to implement Boolean functions directly. Use built-in gate
 primitives for basic functions. Use University program VWF to verify the functionality of your Verilog
 modules. Create waveform and check outputs against expected results.
### PROCEDURE
 1. Type the program in Quartus software.
 2. Compile and run the program.
 3. Generate the RTL schematic and save the logic diagram.
 4. Create nodes for inputs and outputs to generate the timing diagram.
 5. For different input combinations generate the timing diagram.
